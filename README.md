ðŸš€ Data Science Internship Projects at CodSoft ðŸš€

I successfully completed a 1-month Data Science Internship at CodSoft from 1st August to 31st August 2024. This repository contains the projects I worked on during the internship, which provided me with valuable hands-on experience in data science and machine learning.

Projects Included:
Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python ðŸŽ¥

Developed a model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors using regression techniques.
Gained insights into factors influencing movie ratings and improved skills in data analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python ðŸ“Š

Created a model to forecast product sales by analyzing factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and platform selection.
Emphasized the importance of data-driven decision-making in optimizing advertising strategies.
Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸ’³

Built a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using techniques like logistic regression and random forests.
Focused on preprocessing, handling class imbalance, and evaluating model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
I'm grateful to the CodSoft team for this learning experience, which has significantly enhanced my data science expertise. Feel free to explore the code and insights from these projects!
